A website for the quick navigation of the dissemination actions and the developed software of the "RecHumS" (Recreating the Human Skeleton) project. The project was funded by the Hellenic Foundation for Research & Innovation (H.F.R.I.) under the “2nd Call for H.F.R.I. Research Projects to support Postdoctoral Researchers” (Project Number: 1042 – Reconstructing a Human Skeleton: Sorting Human Skeletal Elements from Mass Disasters).

## Communication and dissemination activities

One of the main goals of the "_RecHumS_" project was the communication of its results and developements to a wider audience, such as undergraduate students and professionals in related fields, such as archaeology and forensics. This was achieved by publishing the results in peer-reviewed scientific journals, participating in national and international conferences, and organizing seminars for the undergraduate students. An index for those activities is presented below.

### Publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals:

1. “Paving new ways in forensic contexts with virtual osteology applications: csg-toolkit – a 3D osteology package for GNU Octave” in “Annals of 3D Printed Medicine” ([here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stlm.2022.100094))
2. “Evaluating cross-sectional geometry-based methodologies on an archaeological and historical sample” in “Internation Journal of Oseoarchaeology” ([here](https://doi.org/10.1002/oa.3359))
3. “Sex estimation through the lens off cross-sectional geometric properties of the ulna” in “Forensic Science Reports”, which was accepted in November 27, 2024 (_currently in print_)

### Participation in national and international conferences:

1. “Sex Estimation by Ulna utilizing 3D methodologies”, 42nd Annual Conference of the Hellenic Society for Biological Sciences, Thessaloniki, Greece, on the 18-20th of May, 2023 ([Conference site](https://www.eebe.gr/conference2023/))
2. “Sorting of archaeological skeletal material utilizing their geometric morphometric properties”, 43rd Annual Conference of the Hellenic Society for Biological Sciences, Alexandroupoli, Greece, on the 23-25th of May, 2024 ([Conference site](https://www.eebe.gr/conference2024/))
3. “Sorting of archaeological skeletal material utilizing their geometric morphometric properties”, 4th International Caparica Conference in Translation Forensics”, on the 20-24th of October, 2024 ([Conference site](www.forensics2024.com))

### Organization of seminars:

The seminars were titled " " and were organized and conducted in association with the [Museum of Zoology of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://zoolmuseum.biol.uoa.gr/), for biology, geology, and archeology undergraduate students. The seminars were annual and were conducted on:
1. on 24/02/2023 ([here](https://zoolmuseum.biol.uoa.gr/education/%cf%83%ce%b5%ce%bc%ce%b9%ce%bd%ce%ac%cf%81%ce%b9%ce%bf%cf%81%ce%af%cf%87%ce%bd%ce%bf%ce%bd%cf%84%ce%b1%cf%82-%cf%86%cf%89%cf%82-%cf%83%cf%84%ce%bf-%ce%bc%cf%85%cf%83%cf%84%ce%ae%cf%81%ce%b9/))
2. on 22/04/2024 ([here](https://zoolmuseum.biol.uoa.gr/education/%cf%83%ce%b5%ce%bc%ce%b9%ce%bd%ce%ac%cf%81%ce%b9%ce%bf-%cf%84%ce%b1%ce%be%ce%b9%ce%bd%cf%8c%ce%bc%ce%b7%cf%83%ce%b7-%ce%bf%cf%83%cf%84%cf%8e%ce%bd-%cf%83%ce%b5-%ce%bf%ce%bc%ce%b1%ce%b4%ce%b9/)))


## Developed software

Under the "_RecHumS_" project, a number of software for osteological analysis was developed. This included a tool for the manipulation of 3D skeletal elements and the subsequent extraction of cross-sectional geometric features from the long bones, such as femur, tibia, and humerus, as well as functions for the sorting of skeletal elements. A brief summary of the developed software and hyperlinks to their dedicated Github repositories is provided below.

1. [csg-toolkit](https://github.com/pr0m1th3as/csg-toolkit): a dedicated tool for osteological analysis and the exctraction of cross-sectional geometric . The _`csg-toolkit`_ has been integrated as a GNU Octave package in [GNU Octave Forge](https://gnu-octave.github.io/packages/csg-toolkit/)
2. [sorting of bilateral elements](https://github.com/pr0m1th3as/osteometric-sorting): a GNU Octave programming language function for the osteometric sorting of bilateral long bones, based on cross-sectional geometric properties of 3D models. Supports femur, tibia, humerus, and ulna 3D bone models.
3. [sorting of upper and lower epiphyses fragmentes](https://github.com/NGaroufi/epiphyses_sorting-function): an R programming language function for the sorting of upper and lower epiphyses fragments of long bones. The function utilizes the cross-sectional geometric properties of the femur, tibia, and humerus for the calculation of the least distant pair.
4. [sorting of different long bones](https://github.com/NGaroufi/different_bones_sorting-function): an R programming language function for the sorting of different long bones. The current version of the function can determine the possible matches between (a) femur-tibia bones, (b) femur-humerus bones, and (c) tibia-humerus bones.
